# Solidity Security Demonstrations

A curated collection of Foundry-based tests demonstrating common security risks and user-operation vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

The primary goal is educational: to illustrate real-world attack vectors, their exploitation mechanisms, and effective mitigations through clear, executable examples.

## Usage

Run all tests:

```bash
forge test
```

Run a specific test with verbose output:

```bash
forge test --match-path test/ApproveScam.t.sol -vv
```
